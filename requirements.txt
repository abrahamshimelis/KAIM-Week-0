Goal:
The goal is to analyze environmental data and create a strategy report that recommends where to install solar panels to help the company become more efficient and sustainable.

Objectives:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) analysis on the following:

- Summary Statistics: Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for each numeric column to understand data distribution.

- Data Quality Check: Look for missing values, outliers, or incorrect entries (e.g., negative values where only positive should exist), especially in columns like GHI, DNI, and DHI.

- Time Series Analysis: Analyze how variables like GHI, DNI, DHI, and Tamb change over time. You can plot these metrics across the 'Timestamp' to identify patterns or anomalies.

- Correlation Analysis: Determine the correlation between different variables like solar radiation components (GHI, DHI, DNI) and temperature measures (TModA, TModB) to uncover relationships.

- Wind Analysis: Explore wind speed (WS, WSgust, WSstdev) and wind direction (WD, WDstdev) data to identify any trends or notable wind events.

- Temperature Analysis: Compare module temperatures (TModA, TModB) with ambient temperature (Tamb) to see how they are related or vary under different conditions.

- Histograms: Create histograms for variables like GHI, DNI, DHI, WS, and temperatures to visualize the frequency distribution of these variables.

- Box Plots: Use box plots to examine the spread and presence of outliers in the solar radiation and temperature data.

- Scatter Plots: Generate scatter plots to explore the relationships between pairs of variables, such as GHI vs. Tamb, WS vs. WSgust, or any other potentially interesting pairs.

- Data Cleaning: Based on the initial analysis, clean the dataset by handling anomalies and missing values, especially in columns like Comments which appear entirely null.
